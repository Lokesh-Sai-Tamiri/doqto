              All messages and file transfers on Doqto are protected with

              cannot decrypt your messages. Encryption keys are generated and
              managed on your device and are never transmitted to or stored on
              our servers. Even in the event of a server breach, your message
              content remains unreadable to any unauthorized party, including
