# Doqto — Cross-Stack Enum Contract

> Single source of truth for every enum shared between Flutter and FastAPI.
> Wire values (right column) are the JSON representation — these MUST match exactly on both sides.
> A CI gate (`scripts/check_enum_parity.py`) compares this file to `app/core/enums.py` (Python) and `lib/core/enums/*.dart` (Dart) on every build.

## Rules

1. **Wire values are `snake_case` lowercase strings.** No camelCase on the wire.
2. **Dart enum names are `camelCase`** (Dart idiom), mapped to wire via `@JsonValue('...')`.
3. **Python enum values ARE the wire strings** (use `StrEnum`). Member names can be UPPER_SNAKE.
4. **Adding a value:** update this file → update `enums.py` → update `enums/*.dart` → parity check passes.
5. **Removing a value:** add a migration — never silently drop. Mark deprecated here first.
6. **Reordering:** fine for humans, irrelevant for wire.

## TranscribeSpecialty (AWS Transcribe Medical)

| Wire value | Meaning |

| `CARDIOLOGY` | Cardiology specialty |
| `RADIOLOGY` | Radiology specialty |
| `NEUROLOGY` | Neurology specialty |
| `UROLOGY` | Urology specialty |

## AvatarColor (Flutter-only — no wire)

Index-keyed color cycle from `design.md §2`. Not serialized over the wire; derived deterministically from user index.

| Index | Name | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | blue | `#1A56DB` |
| 1 | teal | `#0ABFAD` |
| 2 | purple | `#7C3AED` |
| 3 | darkBlue | `#0F3499` |
| 4 | amber | `#F59E0B` |

## PersonCard degree (M2 — deliberately NOT an enum)

`PersonCardOut.degree` and `PublicProfileOut.degree` are serialized as a plain
wire STRING — one of `1st` | `2nd` | `3rd` | `out` — not a shared enum. This is
a purely client-facing display badge derived from `RelationshipService`
(`degree_of`: first-degree → `1st`, second-degree → `2nd`, otherwise → `3rd`,
self/blocked → `out`). Keeping it a bare string avoids a three-file enum-parity
dance for a value that never participates in server-side branching. No entry in
the parity SHARED set; no Dart enum mirror required (client parses the string
directly). Likewise `connection_state` (`none` | `pending_outgoing` |
`pending_incoming` | `connected`) and `can_message` (`open` | `request` |
`denied`) are plain profile strings, not gated enums.
